# Freecodecamp tribute page
<p>While I have experience with making projects in Python, this is the first time using git, HTML and CSS to create a webpage. I have detailed who I have dedicated my tribute page to below and then I've listed the top three things I learned during this project.</p>

<p>I chose to create my tribute page based off my fascination with all aspects of technology and how they come together to make something impressive. Emmanuelle Charpentier was chosen specifically as she is an impressive woman in STEM who won a Nobel prize in chemistry for her work on CRISPR.

1. How to effectivly use google to problem-solve in a language that I have limited experience with.

3. Ensuring that I can read, understand and impliment user stories when building a project.
